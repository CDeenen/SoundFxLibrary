# SoundFx Library
This module contains audio effects, and offers no functionality on its own.<br>
Included are over 150 sound effects and loops, ranging from combat hit sounds to forest ambient loops.<br>
<br>
None of the included sounds were made by me. They are all licensed in such a way that I am allowed to share them in this library.<br>
Details on the creators, licenses, changes I've made and links to the source can be found in Attribution.xlsx<br>
<br>
Please note that while you are allowed to use all of these sounds for your personal games, not all sounds are licensed to be used in a commercial settings.
It is up to you to check the license of each sound you're using, Attribution.xlsx might contain errors, no rights can be derived from that document.<br>
<br>
You do not need to enable this module in 'Manage Modules', as this does nothing.<br>
<br>
Here is a list of modules that can be used to create soundboards, in order to play these sounds:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/BlitzKraig/fvtt-SoundBoard">Soundboard by Blitz</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdeenen/materialdeck">Material Deck</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/cdeenen/materialkeys">Material Keys</a></li>
</ul>

## Importing Sounds into Material Deck or Material Keys
When selecting a sound for the module's soundboard, select 'File Picker'. When the file browser is open, make sure it is set to 'User Data' at the top. 
Then browse to 'modules/soundfxlibrary' and then select the category you want and pick a sound.

## Importing Sounds in Soundboard by Blitz
Make sure you've set a custom soundboard directory in Soundboard's module settings. Copy sounds from 'modules/soundfxlibrary' into that directory. Use folders to create categories.
